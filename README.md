# No-Sponsored-Content
An app that removes sponsored content on Facebook.

You can install and debug by cloning the repo, open chrome, Options>More tools>Extensions, select developer mode, load unpacked extension.

The app is quite simple and it would be easy for facebook to bypass it. But it was also easy to make. Effectively, it just goes through
the facebook page, and looks for things with the heading suggested post or sponsored and removes them.
